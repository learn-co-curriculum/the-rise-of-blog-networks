# The Rise Of Blog Networks

## Outline / Notes

  Tell the student about the rise of the blog networks like livejournal, sort of like they are predecessors to social networks, then they lead to things like wordpress and opensource and blogger (whcih is twitter and medium's founder) 

  - livejournal / wordpress / blogger (twitter)
    - points here are to suggest the communal nature of blogging we all blog together and that blogging and code that empowers people go hand in hand.
  - technorati
    - aggregation and blogs start getting cited in press and other stories.

  blogging becomes not just a personal medium but a communtiy of content creators defining a new medium together. it's social, it's viral, it's one of the first massively adopted 
  applications built ontop of the internet.    

  i like how tied to open-source and programming blogging is...so many of our first programs were blogs, they took us through static vs dynamic web applications t

  oo (https://movabletype.org/ was a static one wordpress was dynamic)
